#  HW7-ReadME-Generator

##  nodgyd

## Description
- The purpose of this application was to expand my knowledge on Node.js and its utilization within applications and software. 
- Built this project in order to understand how node operates within the command line and can be utilized to make everyday tasks that much easier.
- This solved a problem in generating a ReadMe.MD when necessary so that I utilize the application whenever I want too! 
- I learned a lot about object deconstruction, node.js properties, calling other js docs, and creating specific documents with the filesystm.
